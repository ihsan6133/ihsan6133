Hello! I am a 15 year old exploring the world of computer science and programming. I like to work with various languages and build fun tools with them. 


Currently, I am working with rust ðŸ¦€ and I really am loving it, and it feels like a breathe of fresh air after working with c++ for some time. A standardized build system, strict ownership rules, superior macros, and much more!
